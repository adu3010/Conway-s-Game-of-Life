# Conway's Game-of-Life

Welcome to Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation created by mathematician John Conway. This project is a part of my Masters Coursework, 'Adaptive Systems' which I am currently studying. It provides a Python implementation of the Game of Life, allowing you to explore the fascinating dynamics of simple rules applied to a grid of cells.

# Features:
Interactive Simulation: Watch as patterns evolve in real-time on the grid.
Customizable Grid: Choose the size of the grid and initial configurations to experiment with different scenarios.
Pattern Library: Includes a collection of well-known patterns to kickstart your simulations.
Configurable Rules: Modify the rules of the game to observe how different conditions affect the outcome.


# Getting Started:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, etc.).
Run the main script to start the simulation.
Experiment with different configurations and observe the emergent behaviors.
